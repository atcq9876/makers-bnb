# makers-bnb

## About this project
Makersbnb is a web-app similar to Airbnb and was built using Ruby and Sinatra. It allows users to: sign up and log in; view, create and book property listings; manage booking requests; and send messages to hosts and customers. This was a group project completed during week 5 of the Makers bootcamp.

## Learnings from this project
Through creating this app in a group environment, I improved my ability to:
- Work and communicate effectively as part of a team to build a web
  application
- Break down projects into tasks and assign them to pairs
- Use agile ceremonies to organise work into sprints and improve processes
- Use the developer workflow to plan, implement and peer-review features
- Build a fullstack web application using Ruby and the Sinatra framework
- Create SQL databases and implement routes that interact with and manipulate data in these databases
- Implement user authentication using bcrypt
- Carry out unit and integrations tests with RSpec
- Use Embedded Ruby (ERB) to dynamically edit HTML view pages
- Style websites with CSS
